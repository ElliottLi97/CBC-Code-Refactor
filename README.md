# CBC-Code-Refactor

Here is my attempt at refactoring and cleaning pre-existing starter code.

HTML Changes: 

    1. Gave the website a more descriptive title instead of "title"
    2. Renamed div elements to more descriptive semantic HTML [aside,summary,footer]
    3. Merged several classes with duplicate attributes into singular classes
    4. Added an alt name to each image
    5. Reordered/Renamed h tags to make them fall into sequential order
    6. Removed redundant ids that were not present in the CSS file

CSS changes:

    1. Merged several classes with duplicate attributes into singular classes
    2. Renamed classes to improve clarity
